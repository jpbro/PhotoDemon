'This tool allows the user to "shear" an image, or convert it from a rectangle to a parallelogram.
' Supersampling and reverse-mapped interpolation are available for a high-quality transformation.
'
'This version does not change the size of the final image.  A separate shear tool should be written that operates
' at an Image level, and it will provide the ability to resize the output to contain the entire sheared image.
