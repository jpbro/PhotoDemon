'Imitation HDR Tool
'Copyright 2014-2017 by Tanner Helland

'Last update: migrate to XML params, minor performance improvements
'
'This is a heavily optimized imitation HDR function.  HDR normally works by having a photographer take multiple shots
' of a scene (3-5, typically), each at a unique exposure.  Software then merges those photos together, selecting pixels
' from each exposure and blending them to produce an evenly exposed photo across a wide luminance range.  This not only
' produces a neat visual effect, but also reproduces detail in ways that would be impossible in a single exposure.
'
'While a merge-to-HDR function that operates in the traditional manner would be nice to eventually include in PD, the
' trouble of asking a photographer to capture multiple back-to-back photos, each at a different exposure, without
' shaking the camera, is no small feat.  The inclusion of HDR as a built-in mode on many cameras and smartphones has
' also reduced the utility such a technique in a separate piece of software.
'
'So instead, what I've done here is put together a tool that mimics the results of HDR, using a contrast-adaptive local
' equalization function.  The details are complicated, but basically the function calculates a local average around
' each pixel, using a user-supplied radius (presented in PD as "quality").  The difference between the current pixel and
' that average is then amplified and applied to each channel; this allows regions of color to stay consistent,
' without the distortion inherent to global equalization.
'
'Anyway, assuming the original photograph was exposed reasonably well, this function should produce a good result.
' Poorly exposed original photographs cannot be saved by this technique, however, especially if a smartphone camera
' or other cheap sensor was used, as the inherent noise will screw up the filter's ability to properly solve the
' partial histogram problem.  C'est la vie.  Applying a median or noise-reduction filter in advance might help to
' improve the output.
