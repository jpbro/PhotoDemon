'Preset Editor Dialog
'Copyright 2014-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 06/March/15
'Last updated: 02/September/15
'Last update: convert to the new mini-command-bar UC
'
'PD supports last-used and custom user-entered presets for pretty much every tool in the program.  This was a massive
' undertaking, and it still has a lot of papercuts that drive me nuts (e.g. not being able to delete past presets,
' short of manually editing the XML file yourself - ugh!).
'
'The correct solution is to provide some kind of editor form, where the user can add/rename/delete (sort?) presets at
' their leisure.  This dialog will eventually become that editor, but at present, it's missing a number of features.
' My first goal is just getting "add preset" working, so I can finally convert the command bar over to new PD-specific
' controls (particularly pdButtonToolbox).
