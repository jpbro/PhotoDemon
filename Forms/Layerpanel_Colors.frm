'PhotoDemon Color Selector Tool Panel
'Copyright 2015-2015 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 15/October/15
'Last updated: 20/October/15
'Last update: actually implement color selection controls!
'
'As part of the 7.0 release, PD's right-side panel gained a lot of new functionality.  To simplify the code for
' the new panel, each chunk of related settings (e.g. layer, nav, color selector) was moved to its own subpanel.
'
'This form is the subpanel for the color selector panel.  It is currently under construction.
