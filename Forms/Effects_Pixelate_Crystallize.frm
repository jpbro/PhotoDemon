'PhotoDemon's crystallize effect is implemented using Worley Noise (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise),
' which is basically a special algorithmic approach to Voronoi diagrams (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
'
'The associated pdVoronoi class does most the heavy lifting for this effect.  For details on this class and how it
' works, I recommend referring to the Stained Glass effect dialog, which details it in much more detail.
'
'I should give a special thanks to Robert Rayment, who did extensive profiling and research on this filter before I ever
' began work on it.  His comments were invaluable in determining the shape and style of this class.  FYI, Robert's PaintRR
' project has a faster and simpler version of this routine worth checking out if PD's methods seem like overkill!
