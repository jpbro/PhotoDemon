'Stained Glass Effect Interface
'Copyright 2014-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 14/July/14
'Last updated: 26/July/17
'Last update: performance improvements, migrate to XML params
'Dependencies: pdRandomize
'
'PhotoDemon's stained glass effect is implemented using Worley Noise (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise),
' which is basically a special algorithmic approach to Voronoi diagrams (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
'
'The associated pdVoronoi class does most the heavy lifting for this effect.  The main fxStainedGlass function basically
' forwards all relevant parameters to a pdVoronoi instance, applies a first pass over the image, caching matching
' Voronoi indices as it goes, then using those indices in a second pass to recolor the image.
'
'Parameters are currently available for a number of tweaks; these will be refined further as the tool nears completion.
' (As a warning, some methods may be dropped in the interest of simplifying the dialog.)
'
'Finally, note that multiple lookup tables are used to improve the performance of this function.  While these may
' seem excessive, the fact that we can produce the entire effect without copying the current image is pretty awesome,
' so despite the many lookup tables, this actually uses less RAM than many other effects in PD.
'
'I should give a special thanks to Robert Rayment, who did extensive profiling and research on this filter before I ever
' began work on it.  His comments were invaluable in determining the shape and style of this class.  FYI, Robert's PaintRR
' project has a faster and simpler version of this routine worth checking out if PD's methods seem like overkill!
