'Last update: add automatic high-DPI cursor support for custom cursors created from PNGs
'
'Because VB6 doesn't provide many mechanisms for working with icons, I've had to manually add a number of icon-related
' functions to PhotoDemon.  As of 7.0, all icons in the program are stored in PD's custom resource file (in a variety of
' formats, each one optimized for file size).  These icons are extracted, re-colored, resized (for high-DPI screens),
' and rendered onto UI elements at run-time.
'
'Menu icons currently use the clsMenuImage class by Leandro Ascierto.  Please see that class for details on how it works.
' (A link to Leandro's original project can also be found there.)
'
'This module also handles the rendering of dynamic form, program, and taskbar icons.  When an image is loaded and active,
' those icons can change to match the current image.  For an overview on how this works, you can see the following MSDN page:
' http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318876
