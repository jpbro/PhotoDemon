'Viewport Handler - builds and draws the image viewport and associated scroll bars

'Last update: reinstate all color management code under LittleCMS (instead of the Windows ICM engine, which is a hot mess)
'
'Module for handling the image viewport.  The render pipeline works as follows:
' - ViewportEngine.Stage1_InitializeBuffer: calculate all viewport position and overlay rects (required only on first image load,
'                                           when image size is changed, or when viewport zoom changes)
' - ViewportEngine.Stage2_CompositeAllLayers: composite all layers in the active image, while accounting for things like
'                                             non-destructive modifications.  Because this function only composites the subset of
'                                             the image relevant to the target viewport, it must be called on canvas scrollbar changes.
' - ViewportEngine.Stage3_CompositeCanvas: composite the image with any underlying/overlying canvas UI elements.  At present, this stage
'                                          handles color management and selection tool compositing, when active.
' - ViewportEngine.Stage4_FlipBufferAndDrawUI: composite any interactive UI elements (transform nodes, paint tool outlines, etc) to the
'                                              canvas, then flip everything to the screen.
'
'If you need to draw something to the screen, you need to call the *latest possible pipeline stage*.  Stages are sorted in rough order
' of their "time-to-completion" requirements, and unnecessarily calling early pipeline stages will hurt program performance.

'Due to the complexity of viewport rendering, some viewport pipeline calculations are stored at module-level, while others are
' stored inside the source pdImage or destination pdCanvas used for a given rendering.  The module-level variables in particular are
' used to improve efficiency over passing objects as parameters, because PD's viewport pipeline is as an "out of order" pipeline.
' Different user interations trigger execution of the pipeline at different stages, which is crucial for maximizing viewport performance.

' source pdImage or destination pdCanvas objects.  CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.

'Per its name, Stage1_InitializeBuffer is responsible for preparing a bunch of math related to viewport rendering.  Its duties include:
    '1) Calculating all zoom-related math
    '2) Determining max/min values of scroll bars
    '3) Canvas offsets, if the image is zoomed out far enough that dead space is present in the viewport.
    '4) (optionally) Calculating new scroll bar values if the user requests it (e.g. for preserving cursor position during mousewheel-to-zoom)
    
'This function is crucial, because all subsequent pipeline operations operate on the rectangles determined by this function.

'Because this function does no actual rendering - only preparation math - it only needs to be executed under specific conditions,
' namely when:
    '1) an image is first loaded
    '2) the viewport's zoom value is changed
    '3) the main PhotoDemon window is resized
    '4) edits that modify an image's size (resizing, rotating, etc - basically anything that changes the relationship between image size
    '   and the canvas buffer(s))

'Because the full rendering pipeline must be executed when this function is called, it is considered highly expensive, even though
' the math it performs is relatively quick.  The main issue caused by this function is that the current canvas's front and back buffers
' will need to be recreated (instead of just reused, as their size has likely changed), so whenever you need to call the viewport to
' request a redraw, try to figure out how late in the pipeline you can call - performance will improve accordingly.

'While this function is primarily concerned with the math required to handle zoom and scroll operations correctly, there are a few
' additional parameters that are occasionally necessary, which is why a ParamArray is used.  For details on these, please refer to the
' "Zoom to Coordinate" behavior, which is used when the mousewheel is invoked while over the current viewport.  That function will pass
' additional targetX and targetY parameters to this function, which are then used to automatically set matching scroll bar values after
' viewport calculations are complete, in a way that preserves the on-screen position of the passed coordinate.  (Note that the function
' does this as closely as it can, but some zoom changes make this impossible, such as zooming out to a point that scroll bars cannot
' physically reach).

'As an important follow-up note, two sets of target coordinates must be passed for this capability to work: one set of coordinates
' in *canvas space*, and one set in *image space*.  Both are required, because Stage1_InitializeBuffer doesn't keep track of past zoom values.
' This means that once the viewport's zoom level has been changed (as will likely happen prior to calling this function, by mousewheel),
' this function doesn't know what the prior zoom level was - and a single set of coordinates is not enough to maintain image positioning.

'Thus, when making use of "zoom to coordinate" behavior, you must handle zoom changes in the following order:
' 1) cache x/y coordinate values in two coordinate spaces: image and canvas
' 2) disable automatic canvas redraws
' 3) change the zoom value; this allows the zoom engine to reconstruct conditional values, like "fit to window"
' 4) re-enable automatic canvas redraws (this can happen now, or after step 5 - just don't forget to do it!)
' 5) request a manual redraw via Stage1_InitializeBuffer, and be sure supply your previously cached x/y values
