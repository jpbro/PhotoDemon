'Unified Compression Interface for PhotoDemon
'Copyright 2016-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 02/December/16
'Last updated: 12/December/16
'Last update: add support for Windows Compression API, available on Win 8+
'Dependencies: - standalone plugin modules for whatever compression engines you want to use (e.g. the
'              Plugin_ZLib module for zlib compression).  This module simply wraps those dedicated functions,
'              and it performs no library initialization or termination of its own.
'              - OS module (for detecting Windows version, necessary for the MS compression engines)
'
'As of v7.0, PhotoDemon performs a *lot* of custom compression work.  There are a lot of different needs in
' image processing - for example, when the user saves a large, multi-layer image, it's okay to take plenty of time
' and squeeze every last bit of compression you can out of the finished file (which is potentially enormous).
' But when saving Undo/Redo data for rapid operations like paint strokes, you want to dump data out to file as
' quickly as humanly possible, with a compression strategy that's as close as possible to HDD performance limits.
'
'For a long time, I used zLib as the program's sole compression interface.  zLib works "well enough" for most
' workloads, with controllable trade-offs between performance and compression, but even at its fastest settings,
' zLib is still one of the slowest available compressors.  (Not surprising, really, given its emphasis on
' portability over all else.)
'
'The past few years have seen a flurry of work on compression algorithms, making it a great time to expand
' PD's compression library coverage.  Zstd came first (http://facebook.github.io/zstd/).  It is basically a
' modernized, superior-in-every-way replacement for zLib.  At its fastest speed setting, it is significantly
' faster than zLib (~4-5x) with only marginally worse compression ratios, while at comparable speed settings,
' it compresses better than zLib across every workload.  Can't argue with that!
'
'Also supported is the lz4 library (http://lz4.github.io/lz4/), developed by the same mad genius as zstd.
' lz4 emphasis real-time compression and decompression speeds, and while its compression ratios are worse
' than both zLib and zstd, it is a full order of magnitude faster.  Its decompression speeds rank among the best
' of any active compression library, making it a useful and unique addition to the corpus.  (It is also the only
' VB-friendly compression library I know of where its performance is good enough to provide concrete benefits
' when reading/writing temp files, because its compression-speed-to-compressed-size ratio is high enough to
' outperform typical disk I/O on a 7200 RPM HDD.)
'
'lz4-hc is also supported.  It is a high-compression variant of lz4, with compression times closer to zLib,
' but the same blazing decompression speeds as stock lz4.  Its support is provided by the stock lz4 library.
'
'I've also included support for the various built-in Windows compression algorithms.  These are only available
' on Win 8 or later, making them poor choices for portability, but if you're only targeting new PCs, they will
' give you compression access without any external dependencies.  (Note that - like most things MS - none of
' the algorithms outperform the 3rd-party solutions, so adjust your expectations accordingly.)
'
'Anyway, the purpose of this module is to simplify code across PD by using standardized compression functions.
' Simply specify the compressor you desire, and this module will silently plug in the right compression or
' decompression code.  (Note that - at present - you *must* request the correct decompressor at decompression
' time, meaning you can't just hand a compressed stream to this module and expect it to magically
' reverse-engineer which decompression engine to use.  That's *your* job.)
'
'All wrapper code in this function is written from scratch by me.  It is not based on any preexisting work.
' This module is, as usual, licensed under the same BSD license governing PD as a whole, so feel free to use
' it in any application, commercial or otherwise.  Bug reports are always welcome.

'
'Copies of these libraries are all custom-built by me as stdcall variants to simplify interop with VB.  Feel free
' to drop-in your own compiled copies, but note that the usual caveats apply if you go with the stock cdecl
' versions - e.g. you will need a safe wrapper around DispCallFunc, such as
