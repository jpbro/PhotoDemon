'Last update: migrate various functions out of the high-level "Loading" module and into this new, format-specific module
'
'This module provides low-level "import" functionality for importing image files into PD.  You will not generally want
' to interface with this module directly; instead, rely on the high-level functions in the "Loading" module.
' They will intelligently drop into this module as necessary, sparing you the messy work of having to handle
' format-specific details (which are many).
