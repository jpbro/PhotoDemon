'Automatic Software Updater
'Copyright 2012-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/August/12
'Last updated: 23/October/17
'Last update: kill off some update preferences that no longer make sense (e.g. patching core plugins separately)
'
'This module includes various support functions for determining if a new version of PhotoDemon is available for download.
'
'IMPORTANT NOTE: at present this doesn't technically DO the updating (e.g. overwriting program files), it just CHECKS for updates.
'
'As of March 2015, this module has been completely overhauled to support live-patching of PhotoDemon and its various support files
' (plugins, languages, etc).  Various bits of update code have been moved into the new update support app in the /Support folder.
' The use of a separate patching app greatly simplified things like updating in-use binary files.
'
'Note that this code interfaces with the user preferences file so the user can opt to not check for updates and never
' be notified again. (FYI - this option can be enabled/disabled from the 'Tools' -> 'Options' menu.)
