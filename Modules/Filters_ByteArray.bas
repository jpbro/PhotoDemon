'Last update: start assembling byte-array-specific filter collection
'
'After version 6.6 released, I started work on a number of modified PD filters.  Unlike most filters in the project
' - which explicitly operate on pdDIB objects - these filters are modified to run on single-channel 2D byte arrays.
' In some places in the project, byte arrays contain sufficient detail for things like bumpmaps, and they consume
' less memory and are faster to process than a three- or four-channel DIB.
'
'Going forward, it would be nice to further expand this function collection, but in the meantime, just know that
' the functions in this module cannot directly operate on images.  Also, they do not generally support progress
' bar reports (by design) as their emphasis is on raw performance.

'Gaussian blur filter, using an IIR (Infininte Impulse Response) approach
'
'I developed this function with help from http://www.getreuer.info/home/gaussianiir
' Many thanks to Pascal Getreuer for his valuable reference.
'
'IIR provides many benefits over a naive Gaussian Blur implementation:
' - It's performed in-place, meaning a second array is not required.  (That said, the function requires floating-point data,
'    so an intermediate float-type array *is* currently needed.)
' - It approaches a true Gaussian over multiple iterations, but at low iterations, it provides a closer estimate than the
'    corresponding box blur filter would.
' - Floating-point radii are supported.
' - Most importantly, it's much faster to calculate!
'
'Note that the incoming arrayWidth and arrayHeight parameters are 1-based, so this function will automatically subtract 1 to arrive
' at an actual UBound value.
