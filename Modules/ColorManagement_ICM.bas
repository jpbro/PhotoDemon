'
'ICC profiles can be embedded in certain image file formats.  These profiles can be used to convert an image into
' a precisely defined reference space, while taking into account any pecularities of the device that captured the
' image (typically a camera).  From that reference space, we can then convert the image into any other
' device-specific color space (typically a monitor or printer).
'
'ICC profile handling is broken into three parts: extracting the profile from an image, using the extracted profile to
' convert an image into a reference space (currently sRGB only), and then activating color management for any
' user-facing DCs using the color profiles specified by the user.  The extraction step is currently handled via
' FreeImage or GDI+, while the application step is handled by Windows.  In the future I may look at adding ExifTool as
' a possible mechanism for extracting the profile, as it provides better support for esoteric formats than FreeImage.
'
'This class does not perform the extraction of ICC Profile data from images.  That is handled by the pdICCProfile
' class, which operates on a per-image basis.  This module simply supplies a number of generic ICC-related functions.
'
'This module would not be possible without this excellent test code from pro VB coder LaVolpe:
' http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?666143-RESOLVED-ICC-%28Color-Profiles%29
' Note that LaVolpe's code contains a number of errors, so if you're looking to build your own ICC implementation,
' I suggest basing it off my work instead.
