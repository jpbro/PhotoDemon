'Created: 31/May/13
'Last updated: 26/April/15
'Last update: start splitting relevant bits from pdFont into this separate manager module.  pdFont still exists for
'              GDI font rendering purposes.
'
'For many years, PhotoDemon has used the pdFont class for GDI text rendering.  Unfortunately, that class was designed before I
' knew much about GDI font management, and it has some sketchy design considerations that make it a poor fit for PD's text tool.
'
'As part of a broader overhaul to PD's text management, this new Fonts module has been created.  Its job is to manage a
' font cache for this system, which individual font classes can then query for things like font existence, style, and more.
'
'Obviously, this class relies heavily on WAPI.  Functions are documented to the best of my knowledge and ability.
