'Last update: add support for window subclassing via built-in WAPI functions; I'm migrating PD to this faster
' (and safer) alternative instead of the old-school cSelfSubHookCallback approach.
'
'PhotoDemon relies on a lot of "not officially sanctioned" VB6 behavior to enable various optimizations and C-style
' code techniques. If a function's primary purpose is a VB6-specific workaround, I prefer to move it here, so I
' don't clutter up purposeful modules with obscure, VB-specific hackery.
'
'Note that some code here may seem redundant (e.g. identical functions suffixed by data type, instead of declared
' "As Any") but that's by design - e.g. to improve safety since these techniques are almost always crash-prone if
' used incorrectly or imprecisely.
'
'A number of the techniques in this module were devised with help from Karl E. Peterson's work at http://vb.mvps.org/
