'PNGQuant Interface (formerly pngnq-s9 interface)

'Created: 19/December/12
'Last updated: 02/July/14
'Last update: migrate all plugin support to the official pngquant library.  Work on pngnq-s9 has pretty much
'              evaporated since late 2012, so pngquant is the new workhorse for PD's specialized PNG needs.
'
'Module for handling all pngquant interfacing.  This module is pointless without the accompanying
' pngquant plugin, which will be in the App/PhotoDemon/Plugins subdirectory as "pngquant.exe"
'
'pngquant is a free, open-source lossy PNG compression library.  You can learn more about it here:
'
' http://pngquant.org/
'
'PhotoDemon has been designed against v2.5.2.  You should be able to replace PD's pngquant.exe copy with any
' valid 2.x release, including your own custom-compiled copy, without trouble.  Additional documentation regarding
' the use of pngquant is available as part of the official pngquant library, downloadable from http://pngquant.org/.
'
'pngquant was originally available under a BSD license.  I believe subsequent releases have changed to a
' dual-license with GPLv3.  Please see the App/PhotoDemon/Plugins/pngquant-README.txt file for questions regarding
' copyright or licensing, or for the most up-to-date information, go straight to http://pngquant.org/.

'All source code in this file is licensed under a modified BSD license.  This means you may use the code in your own
