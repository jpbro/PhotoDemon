'
'PhotoDemon's Autosave engine is closely tied to the pdUndo class, so some understanding of that class is necessary
' to appreciate how this module operates.
'
'All Undo/Redo data is saved to the hard drive, in a temp folder of the user's choosing (the Windows temp folder
' by default).  The data is cleared whenever an image is unloaded, and an extra pass is made at program shutdown
' "just to be safe".
'
'In the event of an unclean shutdown, this module searches the temp folder for any PhotoDemon-specific data.  If
' some is found, the user is given a choice to restore those files.  If the user declines, that data is wiped
' (to prevent future unclean shutdown checks from re-detecting it).
'
'As part of its Autosave functionality, this module also handles the creation and subsequent destruction of a
' "clean shutdown" file.
