'
'This module provides high-level "load" functionality for getting image files into PD.  There are a number of different ways to do this;
' for example, loading a user-facing image file is a horrifically complex affair, with lots of messy work involved in metadata parsing,
' UI prep, Undo/Redo stuff, and more.  Conversely, loading an image file as a resource or internal image can bypass a lot of those steps.
'
'Note that these high-level functions call into a number of lower-level functions inside the ImageImporter module, and potentially various
' plugin-specific interfaces (e.g. FreeImage).
'
'TODO list: add GDI+ support for multipage TIFF loading.  This doesn't look too hard, and given the complexity of TIFF files,
' it'd be worthwhile to have a backup plan if FreeImage chokes on a file.

Option Explicit

'This function is used for loading a user-facing image (vs loading an internal PD image).  Loading a user-facing image involves
' a large amount of extra work (like metadata parsing) which we simply don't care about when loading internal resources.
'
'Note that this function will use one of several backends to load a given image; different filetypes are preferentially handled by
' different means, so portions of this function may call into external DLLs for parts of its functionality.  (The interaction between
' this function and various plugins is complex; I recommend studying the separate ImageImporter module for details.)
'
'INPUTS:
' 1) srcFile: fully qualified, absolute path to the source image.  Unicode is fully supported.
' 2) [optional] suggestedFilename: if loading an image from a temp file (e.g. clipboard, scanner), this value will be used in two places:
'                                  as the image's window caption, prior to first-save, and as the suggested filename at first-save.  As such,
'                                  make it user-friendly, e.g. "Clipboard image".
'                                  If this parameter is *not* supplied, the image's current filename will automatically be used.
' 3) [optional] addToRecentFiles: when a file loads successfully, we typically add it to the File > Recent Files list.  Some load operations,
'                                 like "Add new layer from file", or restoring a file from Autosave, don't easily fit into this paradigm.
'                                 This value tells the load engine to skip the "add to recent files" step.
' 4) [optional] suspendWarnings: at times, the caller may not want to have UI warnings raised for malformed or invalid files.  Batch processing
'                                and multi-image load are two examples.  If suspendWarnings = TRUE, any user-facing messages related to
'                                bad files will be suppressed.  (Note that the warnings can still be retrieved from debug logs, however.)

    '*** AND NOW, AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT DOEVENTS ***
    
    'Normally, PD avoids DoEvents for all the obvious reasons.  This function is a stark exception to that rule.  Why?
    
    'While this function stays busy loading the image in question, the ExifTool plugin runs asynchronously, parsing image metadata
    ' and forwarding the results to a ShellPipe instance on PD's primary form.  By using DoEvents throughout this function, we periodically
    ' yield control to that ShellPipe instance, which allows it to clear stdout so ExifTool can continue pushing metadata through.
    ' (If we don't do this, ExifTool will freeze when stdout fills its buffer, which is not just possible but *probable*, given how much
    ' metadata the average JPEG contains.)
    
    'That said, please note that a LOT of precautions have been taken to make sure DoEvents doesn't cause reentry and other issues.
    ' Do *not* mimic this behavior in your own code unless you understand the repercussions involved!
