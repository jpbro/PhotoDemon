'
'The pdFSO class provides Unicode file/folder interactions for PhotoDemon.  However, sometimes you just want to do
' something trivial, like checking whether a file exists, without instantiating a full class (especially because this
' is unnecessarily verbose in VB).  This module wraps a pdFSO instance and allows you to directly invoke common
' functions without worrying about the details.
