'GDI+ Interface

'Created: 1/September/12
'Last updated: 25/July/17
'Last update: fix alpha premultiplication tracking after certain resize operations
'
'This interface provides a means for interacting with various GDI+ features.  GDI+ was originally used as a fallback for image loading
' and saving if the FreeImage DLL was not found, but over time it has become more and more integrated into PD.  As of version 6.0, GDI+
' is used for a number of specialized tasks, including viewport rendering of 32bpp images, regional blur of selection masks, antialiased
' lines and circles on various dialogs, and more.
'
'Note that - by design - some enums in this class differ subtly from the actual GDI+ enums.  This is a deliberate decision
' to make certain enums play more nicely with other imaging libraries and/or features.  PD handles translation between the
' correct enums as necessary.
'
'These routines are adapted from the work of a number of other talented VB programmers.  Since GDI+ is not well-documented
' for VB users, I first pieced this module together from the following pieces of code:
' Avery P's initial GDI+ deconstruction: http://planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=37541&lngWId=1
' Carles P.V.'s iBMP implementation: http://planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=42376&lngWId=1
' Robert Rayment's PaintRR implementation: http://planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=66991&lngWId=1
' Many thanks to these individuals for their outstanding work on graphics in VB.

'PixelOffsetMode controls how GDI+ calculates positioning.  Normally, each a pixel is treated as a unit square that covers
' the area between [0, 0] and [1, 1].  However, for point-based objects like paths, GDI+ can treat coordinates as if they
' are centered over [0.5, 0.5] offsets within each pixel.  This typically yields prettier path renders, at some consequence
' to rendering performance.  (See http://drilian.com/2008/11/25/understanding-half-pixel-and-half-texel-offsets/)
