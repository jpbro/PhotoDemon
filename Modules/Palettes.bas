'Last update: add the WAPI palette matching function, which is quite a bit faster than our naive version.
'
'This module contains a bunch of helper algorithms for generating optimal palettes from arbitrary source images,
' and also applying arbitrary palettes to images.  In the future, I expect it to include a lot more interesting
' palette code, including swatch imports from a variety of external sources.
'
'In the meantime, please note that this module has quite a few dependencies.  In particular, it performs
' no quantization (and relatively little palette-matching) on its own.  This is primarily delegated to helper classes.
