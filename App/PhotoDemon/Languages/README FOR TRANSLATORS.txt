Thank you for improving PhotoDemon's language files!

Sometimes, PhotoDemon will automatically update its language files.  When this happens, new language files will be downloaded from photodemon.org, then saved over the files in this folder (/App/PhotoDemon/Languages).

To avoid losing any of your translation work, you *MUST NOT* edit these official language files directly.  If you do, any changes might be overwritten by these automatic language file updates.

Instead, you must do one of two things:

1) Save your translation file in this folder, but with a custom filename, e.g. "Deutsch_edited.xml".  PhotoDemon will not overwrite files with custom file names.
2) Even better, you can save your edited file in the /Data/Languages folder.  Everything in the /App subfolder is reserved for default PhotoDemon files.  These files may be updated by the program.  The /Data/ subfolder is for user files, and any language files saved to the /Data/Languages folder will not be touched by PhotoDemon updates.

Please follow these instructions, so your valuable translation work is never lost!

Thank you again for your help, and if you have any other questions, do not hesitate to contact me:
