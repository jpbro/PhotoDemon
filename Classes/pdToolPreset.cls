'Created: 14/August/13
'Last updated: 07/March/15
'Last update: split some parts of preset management out of the command bar and into this standalone class
'Dependencies: pdXML class (for parsing previously saved preset files)
'              pdFSO class (for saving/loading preset files)
'              pdStringStack class (for returning lists of presets)
'
'Supporting presets for every possible tool is an unpleasant task.  This class is designed to make it easier.
'
'Each command bar contains an instance of this class.  All preset management is forwarded to us, and in return,
' we supply preset names and/or values as the command bar needs them.
'
'This class also handles all preset file/save operations.
