'PhotoDemon DPI-Aware Window Resize class
'Copyright 2015-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 23/September/15 (but built from many parts existing earlier)
'Last updated: 06/February/17
'Last update: migrate to safer subclassing technique
'
'Because VB is only partially DPI-aware, each unique user control has to do a ton of specialized work to support
' resize and move events under non-standard DPI values.  To reduce the amount of redundant code copied between UCs,
' this parent class is used.  It provides replacement move/size functions that rely on WAPI for correct behavior.
