'This class provides convenient, Unicode-friendly replacements for VB's various file and folder functions.  In some cases, the VB
' equivalents have been directly reproduced.  In others, the functions have been rewritten to make fail states easier to detect
' (e.g. returning Boolean's instead of raising errors).
'
'Pay careful attention to the requirements of each function.  Some functions that operate on bare file handles require that the
' handle was created with certain permissions (e.g. you can't check file size using an hFile unless the hFile was created with
' read access).
