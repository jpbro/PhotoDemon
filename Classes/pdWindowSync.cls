'Last update: migrate to safer subclassing technique
'
'The right-side panel in the main PD window supports a number of collapsible panels.  Each panel lives on its own
' form, which helps keep the code organized (as there are so many panels, each with totally different UI needs).
'
'Because it's a pain to manually move/size those forms as panels are moved and/or sized, the parent form uses an
' array of picture boxes to control subpanel layout.  This class then does the messy business of synchronizing the
' various subpanel forms with their representative picture boxes, which allows us to keep the main toolbar and various
' subpanels nicely compartmentalized, while taking advantage of built-in Windows messaging for relaying size/position
' changes to the subpanels whenever the parent window needs to make changes.
'
'Note that this class requires a 1:1 correlation between parent and child hWnds.  You cannot map multiple children
' to the same parent, by design.
