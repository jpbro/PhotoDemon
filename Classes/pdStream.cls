'Generic Stream-like I/O Interface
'Copyright 2016-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 05/December/16
'Last updated: 25/October/17
'Last update: add "DeleteFromStart" function, as part of integration with our asynchronous ExifTool interface
'
'Before I say anything else, please note that this class is based off work originally done by vbforums.com user
' "dilettante", whose original clsBasicBuffer class served PD well for a long time.  clsBasicBuffer is a nice,
' simple, memory-only stream interface that beginners will find much more accessible than this class.  You can
' download the original version of clsBasicBuffer from the following link (good as of December '16):
' http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?710155-VB6-BasicBuffer-Binary-Stream-Class
'
'After hacking the original clsBasicBuffer to pieces to improve performance, it finally reached a point where it
' was time to migrate to a new solution designed from the ground-up for performance.  In addition, PD really needs
' a generic stream object that can be either file-backed or memory-backed, and given the work involved in handling
' both scenarios efficiently, it was easier to rework the class's design to match.
'
'Significant upgrades to pdStream include:
' - Allocations are now controlled automatically, without any user input.  The only user input allowed is a hint for
'   the initial allocation size; this can be passed to the StartBuffer function, and it's very helpful if you have
'   some knowledge of how big the final buffer is likely to be.  If you don't have such knowledge, the default
'   allocator will now handle this intelligently based on the size of incoming write requests.
' - Byte arrays are no longer returned directly from functions.  Instead, the caller must pass their own arrays
'   as parameters.  This class will only resize those arrays as necessary, and the caller can specifically turn off
'   array trimming.  (Without trimming, the array will only be resized if it is currently too small to hold the
'   returned data - and it's up to the caller to check the returned data size and react accordingly.)  This saves a
'   ton of time if we're retrieving multiple large nodes, as we can simply reuse a single very large array.
' - A framework is now place for backing a stream by a file or a memory buffer.  File-backed buffers allow you to
'   stream data directly to a file on persistent media, without requiring a matching in-memory copy.
