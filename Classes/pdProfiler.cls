'PhotoDemon Performance Profiler - Long-term Tracking
'Copyright 2014-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/June/14
'Last updated: 28/August/17
'Last update: code clean-up in preparation for splitting some functionality into a short-term class
'
'As PhotoDemon has grown more complex, I've had to be more careful about overall program performance.  Unfortunately,
' performance is a tough thing to track using default VB code, which is why it became necessary to write a custom
' profiler better tailored to the kind of complex performance analysis PD needs.
'
'pdProfilerLT aims to solve a specific profiling problem: tracking single-occurrence events across multiple sessions,
' and calculating things like average time taken, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation.  At present, I use
' this to track performance of PD's startup process(es), and the profiler results have been incredibly helpful at
' helping me has isolate and solve a number of perf issues during program initialization.
'
'Because this class is meant to be as simple to use as possible *from within PD*, I've added a number of PD-specific bits
' to it, like automatically using the program's known Debug folder for file output, and automatically generating filenames
' from report titles.  These PD-specific instances should be easy to strip out, but as with any class containing a "pd"
' prefix, I haven't gone out of my way to make everything in here project-agnostic.  NB: Use at your own risk!
