'Last update: added support for coalescing timers on Win 8+
'
'Sometimes you want a timer without an attached UserControl (and all the extra objects that entails).  This class
' implements a basic timer message handler, meaning it behaves roughly identically to a VB timer control.  On Windows 8
' or later, a coalescing timer is preferentially used.  See go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=246618 for details.
'
'Because AddressOf does not work in a module, this class leans on a few helper functions in the VBHacks module.
'Also, just like a regular VB Timer, this is a bad solution for high-resolution timing or anything that needs to be
' extremely consistent.
