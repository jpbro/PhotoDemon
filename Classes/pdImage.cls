'PhotoDemon Image class
'Copyright 2006-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: sometime 2006
'Last updated: 13/September/15
'Last update: convert imgStorage to pdDictionary, so we can drop the run-time scrrun.dll requirement
'
'The pdImage class is used to store information on each image loaded by the user.  As such, one instance of this class
' exists for each loaded image.  These instances are stored in the public pdImages() array.
'
'This class doesn't do a lot of its own processing.  At present, it's mainly just a container for key image properties,
' e.g. size, name, file path, format, Undo/Redo tracking - as well as the all-important array of pdLayer objects that
' comprise the image's actual bitmap data.
'
'Generally speaking, this class should not be used separate from its parent pdImages() array.  If you need access to
' a temporary image, use pdDIB, or if layer interactions are required, a single pdLayer instance (and its corresponding
' layerDIB).  This class is quite heavy as it must track things like metadata, undo/redo handling, and other items,
' so avoid using it for any temporary image operations.

'Each active image in the program exists within one of these pdImage objects.  This class stores all relevant information

' It is cached here to make viewport rendering faster and more reliable.

'Scratch layer.  This layer can be used for any temporary work relevant to this image (e.g. storing paintbrush strokes).
' Note that no guarantees are made regarding the scratch layer's initialization, size, or other attributes.  You should
' always verify scratch layer attributes (or call ResetScratchLayer) prior to utilizing it.

'    Original file format is only set once, at load-time, and not changed during a given session.  We must retain
'    it because this value tells us how to parse things like cached metadata (which is often format-specific).
' 2) Current file format.  For example, if the user loads a .BMP file and uses "Save As" to save it as a .JPG,
