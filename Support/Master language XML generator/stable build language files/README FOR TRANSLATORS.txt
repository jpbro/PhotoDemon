Thank you for helping to improve PhotoDemon's translations!

In version 6.6, PhotoDemon gained the ability to automatically update its language files.  It does this independent of the program itself, by checking photodemon.org for new versions, and downloading them when found.

Because of this, it will automatically overwrite the official language files in this folder (/App/PhotoDemon/Languages/).  To avoid losing any of your translation work, you *MUST NOT* edit the official language files directly.  If you do, any changes may be overwritten by a future automatic language patch.

Instead, you must do one of two things:

1) Save your translation file in this directory, but with a new filename, e.g. "Deutsch_edited.xml".  PhotoDemon will not overwrite files with custom file names.
2) The preferred method is to save your edited file in the /Data/Languages folder.  Everything in the /App/ subfolder is reserved for default PhotoDemon files.  These files may be overwritten by future releases.  The /Data/ subfolder is for user files, and any languages saved to the /Data/Languages folder will not be touched by PhotoDemon updates.

Please make sure to follow these instructions, so your valuable work is not lost.

Thank you again for your help, and if you have any other questions, do not hesitate to contact me:
