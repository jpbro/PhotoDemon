'Created: 28/January/15
'Last updated: 10/February/15
'Last update: continued work on initial build
'
'This project was built to help assemble automatic update information for PhotoDemon.  It is run by the nightly build batch
' script, and it assembles a few different things:
' - New pdPackage archives for the latest stable, beta (if relevant), and nightly build entries.
' - A master update file with version numbers and checksums for each of the pdPackage files
'
'NOTE: this project is intended only as a support tool for PhotoDemon.  It is not designed or tested for general-purpose use.
'       I do not have any intention of supporting this tool outside its intended use, so please do not submit bug reports
'       regarding this project unless they directly relate to its intended purpose (generating PhotoDemon update files).
'
'       Also, given this project's purpose, the code is pretty ugly.  Organization is minimal.  Read at your own risk.
