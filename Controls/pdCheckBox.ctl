'PhotoDemon Checkbox control
'Copyright 2013-2017 by Tanner Helland

'Last update: finalize theming support
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this checkbox replacement, specifically:
'
' 1) The control is no longer autosized based on the current font and caption.  If a caption exceeds the size of the
'     (manually set) width, the font size will be repeatedly reduced until the caption fits.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically, so do not attempt to handle this manually.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks on both the button and label are registered properly.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 5) When the control receives focus via keyboard, a special focus rect is drawn.  Focus via mouse is conveyed via text glow.
