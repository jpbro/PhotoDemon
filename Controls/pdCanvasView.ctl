'PhotoDemon "CanvasView" User Control (e.g. the primary component of pdCanvas)
'Copyright 2002-2017 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 29/November/02
'Last updated: 16/February/16
'Last update: migrate the main view portions of pdCanvas into this control, which will greatly simplify paint tool integration
'
'In 2013, PD's canvas was rebuilt as a dedicated user control, and instead of each image maintaining its own canvas inside
' separate, dedicated windows (which required a *ton* of code to keep in sync with the main PD window), a single canvas was
' integrated directly into the main window, and shared by all windows.
'
'In 2016, we refined this further, embedding this unique pdCanvasView object inside the larger pdCanvas object.  pdCanvas has
' manage a lot of things - scroll bars, buttons, a full status bar - and by migrating the main viewer portion into its own
' usercontrol, we gained a lot of flexibility over performance and code separation.  This is especially important as part of
' improving on-canvas tool responsiveness.
'
'To really understand how this control operates, you'll need to examine pdCanvas, as it ultimately deals with the many mouse
' and key events we potentially raise.
