PhotoDemon's documentation is currently a work in progress.  Articles are being added in no particular order, as time allows.  The current goal is to have all documentation finished by 6.4's release. 

Outside contributions are always welcome.  The preferred method of contributing changes is via [PhotoDemon's GitHub repository](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon).  For small corrections or fixes, sending a message via the [PhotoDemon contact page](http://photodemon.org/about/contact/) is fine too.
